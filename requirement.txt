Project Title: Personal Portfolio Website 

Objective:
    To create a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS that showcases personal information, skills, projects, and a contact form.
The website should be responsive and include design concepts learned from Day 3 to Day 6.

Requirements (Day 3 → Day 6 Concepts)
=====================================
Day 3 — float, border, list (ul, ol)
Use float to align your profile image next to text in the About section.
Use border to decorate sections or project cards.
Use ul and li for the navigation menu and the skills list.

Day 4 — display (flex, justify, align), a, hover, button
Use display: flex for layout alignment (Navigation, Projects, Skills).
Use justify-content and align-items to center or space out content.
Use a:hover to add hover effects for navigation links.
Use button:hover to add hover color changes on buttons.

Day 5 — form, input, br, outline
Create a contact form in the Contact section with:
Name, Email, and Message fields (<input> and <textarea>)

A Submit Button
Use outline: none and custom focus styles for input fields.
Use <br> where appropriate to create spacing between elements.

Day 6 — font (Myanmar), icon, responsive (@media)
Use a Myanmar font such as “Noto Sans Myanmar”.
Include Font Awesome icons in the footer (Facebook, Instagram, GitHub).
Use @media queries to make the website responsive:
Projects should stack vertically on small screens.
The About image should center on small devices instead of floating.
